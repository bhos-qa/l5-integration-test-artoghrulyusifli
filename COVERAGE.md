I will try to explain what did I understand from the concept of integration testing

# What is integration testing ?
Integration testing is done to test the modules/components when integrated to verify that they work as expected i.e. to test the modules which are working fine individually does not have issues when integrated.When talking in terms of testing large application using black box testing technique, involves the combination of many modules which are tightly coupled with each other. We can apply the Integration testing technique concepts for testing these types of scenarios.

# Why Integration testing is important ?
As the name implies, integration testing is the process of testing individual components to see how well they perform conjoined. These components are combined to better understand multiple modules operating as a single unit.

In my Project I used Springboot framework in order to make the Integration testing.After I created the project I added the Springboot framework to this project.Consequently, i started to write sprinboot apllication and  integration testings for endpoints using the mockapi.io:

After writing integration testing I used Springboot framework to see if our test is seccesful for endpoints:

As we can see from picture all our integration testings passed test succesfully.
